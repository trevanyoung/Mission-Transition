# Mission Transition

## What is this project and what does it do?

A web application built using Html, Css, Javascript / React, and Reactstrap. I built this particular application with the goal of assisting military veterans by presenting a list of in demand and well paying career fields in conjunction with related educational programs. 

## Planned Updates
Version 1.2 of Mission Transition will impliment a fully functional chat room, and friends list. The components for both are currently in work components. 


## Additional Information
When signing up to test the application I would highly reccomend not using personal information for the username or password due to security reasons.
