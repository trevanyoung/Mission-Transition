# Mission Transition
https://mission-transition.herokuapp.com/

## What is this project and what does it do?

A web application built using Html, Css, Javascript / React, and Reactstrap. The data is managed via JSON server. I built this particular application with the goal of assisting military veterans by presenting a list of in demand and well paying career fields in conjunction with related educational programs.

## Application Use Instructions
Upon the application loading you can create a username and password, and then click register
Once you have registered you are presented with a description and click the blue "Click here to get started button!"
You will now be able to view a list of schools and jobs. You can add each item listed. Once you add the item it will be listed in your schools or jobs respectively. There is also a details button that will create a modal pop up that will show more information about the school or job. You can also add a personal note about the school or job by clicking edit. You can also delete schools. The Gi Bill link on the navbar will display information on how veterans can use their benefits to pay for school as well. 


## Planned Updates
Version 1.2 of Mission Transition will impliment the following features
Chatroom 
FriendsList. 

The components for both are mostly done (code can be viewed in the components folder). Also styling the site in order to make it more accessible on mobile phones and tablet devies. 


## Additional Information
When signing up to test the application I would highly reccomend not using personal information for the username or password due to security reasons.
